# Developer guide

At the moment, there is no dedicated development container, thus you need to configure your local development environment following the steps described below.

## Pre-requisites

- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- [Python](Python) 3.10. You can install it through uv using `uv python install 3.10`
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (if using code repository)
- (optional) [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). Some servers will require to use your AWS credentials to interact with your AWS account. Configure your credentials:

```shell
aws configure --profile [your-profile]
AWS Access Key ID [None]: xxxxxx
AWS Secret Access Key [None]:yyyyyyyyyy
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

## Preparing your Build Environment

Pre-commit checks are crucial for a fast feedback loop while ensuring security practices at the individual change level. To prevent scenarios where these checks are accidentally omitted at the client side, we run it at [CI level](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/.github) too.                                                                                                             |

We highly recommend using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) semantic. We do not enforce conventional commits on contributors to lower the entry bar.

If any hook fails, the commit will be aborted, and you will need to fix the issues before committing again.                                                                                                           |

## Testing

### Testing with a Local Development MCP Server

You can modify the settings of your MCP client to run your local server. Open the your client json settings file and update it as needed. For instance:

```
"awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
    "--directory",
    "<absolute path to your server code>",
    "run",
    "server.py"
    ],
    "env": {
    "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
    },
    "disabled": false,
    "autoApprove": []
},
```

where `<absolute path to your server code>` is the absolute path to the server code, for instance `/Users/myuser/mcp/src/aws-documentation-mcp-server/awslabs/aws_documentation_mcp_server`.

Also, the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) provides [Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers. More information on Inspector can be found in the [documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).

The Inspector runs directly through npx without requiring installation:

```shell
   $ npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <command> <args>
```

For instance, to inspect your locally developed server, you can run:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  uv \
  --directory <absolute path to your server code> \
  run \
  server.py
```
where `<absolute path to your server code>` is the absolute path to the server code, for instance `/Users/myuser/mcp/src/aws-documentation-mcp-server/awslabs/aws_documentation_mcp_server`.

Inspector will run your server on locahost (for instance: http://127.0.0.1:6274). You can then open your browser and connect to the server. For up to date instructions on how to use Inspector, please refer to the [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).

### Unit tests

![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/awslabs/mcp?link=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.codecov.io%2Fgh%2Fawslabs%2Fmcp)

Each MCP server is expected to have a `tests` folder containing unit tests that should meet or exceed merged our reported test coverage (see our "coverage" badge above). For instance, you can refer to an existing server like [AWS Documentation Server](src/aws-documentation-mcp-server/tests/).

| Action            | Explanation                                |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| `cd src/example-mcp-server` | This is the directory containing your server files. |
| `uv run --frozen pytest --cov --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing` | This will run all unit tests for the server and display code coverage. |

| Fix issues | Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation. |
| Merge ! | Once your PR is merged, the changes will be available on the main branch. If you created a new MCP server, the team will take care of the necessary steps to publish the server to the correct package manager. |

### Remediating Detected Secrets

Running `pre-commit run --all-files` at the top-level may show "Failed" when secrets are detected.
Run the scanner against the baseline and then audit the findings and commit `.secrets.baseline`.

```shell
% detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline # which might add detected secrets to the baseline.
% detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline # to remediate updates in the baseline.
```
