# AWS MCP Servers - Samples

This directory contains a collection of examples demonstrating how to use the AWS MCP Servers provided in the `src` directory. Each sample is organized into its own folder with relevant documentation and code.

## Structure

```bash
samples/
├── project-name/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── (sample code and resources)
```

## Purpose

The samples in this directory provide:

- Working examples for each AWS MCP Server
- Integration patterns and best practices
- Code snippets for common use cases
- Step-by-step guides

## Guidelines

- Each sample directory should focus on demonstrating one or more MCP servers
- All samples must include a README.md with clear instructions
- Samples should not introduce new MCP servers, but only demonstrate usage of existing ones

## Available Samples
